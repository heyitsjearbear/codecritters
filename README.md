# 🐾 CodeCritters: A Virtual Pet Game in Python

This isn't just a pet game anymore. This project started as a fun way to rebuild my coding confidence and grow full-stack skills, but it's evolving into a **sandbox for real-world AI systems** — with reinforcement learning agents, LLM-powered behavior trees, and multi-agent coordination.

By the end, CodeCritters will support plug-and-play agents that learn, reason, and interact in a simulated ecosystem.

## 🛠️ Built With
- Python 🐍
- Pygame 🎮 (game front-end)
- Flask 🌐 (API & web dashboard)
- SQLite + SQLAlchemy (user data & pet states)
- Chart.js / Matplotlib (analytics & visualizations)
- OpenAI API / HuggingFace (LLM integrations)
- stable-baselines3 (reinforcement learning)

---

## 🎯 Project Goals
- Relearn Python and OOP through gamified design
- Build a full-stack, production-deployable application
- Explore advanced AI techniques like RL, RAG, LLM agents
- Package & ship a downloadable app with real users
- Showcase devlogs & growth through TikTok

## 📂 How to Run Locally
1. Clone this repo
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the game:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
4. (Optional) Start the backend:
   ```bash
   cd backend && flask run
   ```

## 🧪 Features Under Development
- Save/load game state to database
- Web dashboard with real-time pet stats
- Multi-agent simulations & battle system
- Webcam emotion detection (Vision AI)
- Autonomous agents using LLMs and RL
- Exportable behavior logs for research

---

## 🧠 Why This Matters
While it may look like a virtual pet sim on the surface, CodeCritters is a deeply technical playground for:
- AI experimentation
- Agent-based modeling
- Game-state synchronization
- Full-stack engineering workflows

Whether you're into game dev, backend systems, AI safety, or teaching beginners — this project bridges all those domains in a fun, expressive way.
